                            <p> For my groupâ€™s final project in our database class, CIS 550, we wanted to create a service that could recommend songs based off previous data. This required us to be able to query those popular songs, while also having as much information about each song as we could. Therefore, we created a MySQL database containing multiple Spotify data sets for users to look for songs for any occasion.</p>

The data ingestion procedure will be discussed in the Database section below .For the back-end, we created queries using MySQL and hosted a database using AWS. </p>
                            <p> For  the  front-end,  we  created  a  React  application  that  communicates  with  our  database  using  Node.js,  andused CSS to style the different pages.  The application is split into the client side and the server side, where the client uses data fetched by the server to display and interact with the user, while the server side communicates directly with our AWS database. </p>
