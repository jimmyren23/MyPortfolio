                            <p> This was my first product manager role, and it was an absolute pleasure to lead a technical team for the first time for Penn Spark (formally known as Penn Creative Labs). I held weekly meetings throughout the semester and had to ensure that the moving pieces of the project were coming together while navigating through everyoneâ€™s busy schedules. I also had to do weekly updates on the project to the rest of the club, while communicating our timeline and any issues we may have been having.</p>
                            <p> Working with developers that had a spectrum of web development experience, I made sure that everyone understood what they were working on and ensured that everyone on the team felt comfortable learning and challenging themselves to create new products and features. Leading a team made me further understand the entire process of organizing a successful project. </p>
